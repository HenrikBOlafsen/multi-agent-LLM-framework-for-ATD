Goal
Break the architectural cycle in Werkzeug between:
- `werkzeug/__init__.py`
- `werkzeug/datastructures/range.py`
- `werkzeug/datastructures/__init__.py`
- `werkzeug/urls.py`
- `werkzeug/serving.py`
…without changing behavior or public API.

Important
Please refactor to eliminate this cycle without increasing architectural technical debt elsewhere (no new cycles). My ATD metric treats ANY module reference as a dependency (dynamic/lazy/type-only all count). Making imports lazy (or hiding them under TYPE_CHECKING) is NOT sufficient. I care about architecture (static coupling), not runtime import order. Functionality must not change.

Why this exists (short)
`werkzeug/urls.py` imports the `datastructures` façade solely to get `iter_multi_items`. That façade re-exports from leaf modules and pulls in `range`, which in turn depends upward, closing a 5-node cycle together with `serving` and the package-level `__init__`.

Technique (describe what to do, not exact code)
1) Narrow the dependency in `werkzeug/urls.py`:
   - Import `iter_multi_items` directly from the defining **leaf** module (`werkzeug/datastructures/structures.py`) instead of from the `datastructures` façade (`werkzeug/datastructures/__init__.py`).
   - Add a brief comment explaining this is an internal leaf import to avoid pulling the façade and to keep the graph acyclic.
2) Do not add lazy/dynamic imports or move the cycle elsewhere. Keep the diff minimal.
3) (Only if, after step 1, your analyzer still reports a cycle) Extract any low-level helpers that cause upward imports into a tiny private “foundation” module (e.g., `werkzeug/_http_header_utils.py`) and have both sides import from there. This fallback should be used only if step 1 doesn’t break the cycle.

Scope & guardrails
- Touch as few files as possible; ideally just `werkzeug/urls.py`.
- No behavior changes, no public API changes, no new third-party deps, no broad formatting diffs.
- Avoid introducing any new static edges that could form new SCCs.
- Keep external/public imports (used by library users) unchanged; this is an internal dependency tightening.

Done when
- `werkzeug/urls.py` imports `iter_multi_items` from the leaf module (not via `datastructures` façade).
- The static dependency graph no longer contains the 5-node cycle involving `__init__`, `datastructures/range`, `datastructures/__init__`, `urls`, `serving`.
- No new cycles are introduced elsewhere.
- Tests and linters pass.

Deliverables
- A small diff (preferably a single-line import change + one comment).
- A short note in the commit message explaining: “Narrow `urls` → `datastructures` dependency by importing `iter_multi_items` from leaf module to break import cycle (ATD counts all references; lazy imports don’t help). No behavior or API changes.”

Optional verification
- If an ATD tool is available in the environment, run it before/after and include the SCC summary confirming the cycle is gone. Otherwise, explain in the PR/notes how the static edge `urls → datastructures/__init__` was removed and why that breaks the cycle.
