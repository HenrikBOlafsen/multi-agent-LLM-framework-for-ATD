Goal  
Break the architectural cycle between `tinydb/__init__.py` and `tinydb/database.py` without changing behavior or the public API.

Important  
Please refactor to remove this cycle **without** introducing new cycles or increasing architectural technical debt elsewhere.
My ATD metric treats **any** module reference as a dependency (dynamic/lazy/type-only all count). So just making the import lazy is **not** sufficient. Functionality and public surface (including current re-exports from `tinydb.__init__`) must remain unchanged for users.

Why this exists (short)  
- `tinydb/__init__.py` re-exports names and **imports `TinyDB` from `.database`**.  
- `tinydb/database.py` sets `default_storage_class = JSONStorage` but currently **imports `JSONStorage` via `from . import JSONStorage`**, i.e., from the package namespace (`__init__`), which statically depends on `__init__`.  
These two edges create a bidirectional dependency (`__init__` ↔ `database`) in the static graph.

Technique (describe what to do, not exact code)  
1) In `tinydb/database.py`, **import storages directly from their module**, not via the package:  
   - Replace `from . import JSONStorage` with `from .storages import JSONStorage`.  
   - Keep the existing `from .storages import Storage` import (or combine into one line).  
   This removes `database.py`’s dependency on `__init__.py` while preserving behavior.  
2) Do **not** change `tinydb/__init__.py`’s public re-exports (`TinyDB`, `Storage`, `JSONStorage`, `Query`, `where`) unless strictly necessary for import order. If you touch it, only reorder internal imports to keep behavior identical and the public API intact.  
3) Avoid introducing any new intermediate module just for this; it’s unnecessary here. (Only add files if you discover a hidden coupling that truly requires it—and if so, the new file must be private and dependency-minimal.)

Scope & guardrails  
- Keep the diff minimal: only `tinydb/database.py` (and, if absolutely required for order, small, no-op import order tweaks in `tinydb/__init__.py`).  
- No new third-party deps. No broad formatting changes. No function signature changes.  
- Preserve all docstrings, typing, and runtime behavior (including default `default_storage_class` = `JSONStorage`).  
- The public API remains the same: users can still `from tinydb import TinyDB, where` etc.

Done when  
- `tinydb/database.py` **does not** import from `tinydb` (the package) anymore; it imports `JSONStorage` **directly** from `.storages`.  
- `tinydb/__init__.py` still re-exports `TinyDB`, `Storage`, `JSONStorage`, `Query`, `where` exactly as before.  
- The static dependency graph shows **no cycle** between `tinydb/__init__.py` and `tinydb/database.py`, and **no new cycles** were introduced.  
- All tests and import/use examples continue to work unchanged (e.g., `from tinydb import TinyDB, where` and default storage being `JSONStorage`).
